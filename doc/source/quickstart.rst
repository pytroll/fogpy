============
 Fogpy usage in a nutshell
============

The package uses OOP extensively, to allow higher level metaobject handling.

For this tutorial, we will use a MSG-SEVIRI scene for creating different 
fog products.

Import satellite data first
===========================

We start with the Pytroll package *satpy*. This package provide all functionalities 
to import and calibrate a SEVIRI scene from HRIT files. Therefore you should make sure 
that satpy is properly configured and all environment variables like *PPP_CONFIG_DIR* 
are set and the HRIT files are in the given search path. For more guidance look up 
in the `satpy`_ documentation

.. _satpy: http://satpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#getting-the-files-and-installing-them/

.. note::
	Make sure *satpy* is correctly configured!

Ok, let's get it on::

    >>> from satpy import Scene
    >>> from glob import glob
    >>> filenames = glob("/path/to/seviri/H-000*20131212000*")
    >>> msg_scene = Scene(reader="seviri_l1b_hrit", filenames=filenames)
    >>> msg_scene.load([10.8])
    >>> msg_scene.load(["fog"])

We imported a MSG scene from  12. December 2013 and loaded the 10.8 Âµm channel
and the built-in simple fog composite into the scene object.

Now we want to look at the IR 10.8 channel::

	>>> msg_scene.show(10.8)

.. image:: ./seviri-native-108.jpg

Everything seems correctly imported. We see a full disk image. It's
upside swapped north-south and east-west because Satpy initially shows
it as located in the file. So lets see if we can resample it to a central
European region::

	>>> eu_scene = msg_scene.resample("eurol")
	>>> eu_scene.show(10.8)

.. image:: ./seviri-eurol-108.jpg

A lot of clouds are present over central Europe. Let's test a fog RGB
composite to find some low clouds::

	>>> eu_scene.show("fog")

.. image:: ./seviri-eurol-fog.jpg

The reddish and dark colored clouds represent cold and high altitude clouds, 
whereas the yellow-greenish color over central and eastern Europe is an indication for low clouds and fog.

Continue with more metadata
===========================

In the next step we want to create a fog and low stratus (FLS) composite
for the imported scene.  For this we need:

  * Satellite L1b data, either from SEVIRI with the ``seviri_l1b_hrit``
    reader, or from ABI with the ``abi_l1b`` reader.
  * Cloud microphysical data, either from NWCSAF with the ``nwcsaf-geo``
    reader, or from CMSAF CLAAS-2 with the ``cmsaf-claas2_l2_nc`` reader.
  * A digital elevation model.  For Europe, this can derived from data
    available from the European Environmental Agency (`EEA`_).  For North
    America, we can get data from USGS. To make it available to Fogpy,
    drop ``eu-1km.tif`` and ``new-england-500m.tif`` into the
    ``fogpy/data/DEM`` directory.  Gerrit Holl <gerrit.holl@dwd.de> has the
    files.

We create a scene in which we load
datasets using both the ``seviri_l1b_hrit`` and ``cmsaf-claas2_l2_nc`` readers.
Here we choose to load all required channels and datasets explicitly::

	>>> fn_cmsaf = glob("/media/nas/x20629/SEVIRI/repr2/level2/cpp/2013/12/12/CPPin20131212100000305SVMSG01MD.nc")
	>>> fn_sev = glob("/media/nas/x21308/scratch/SEVIRI/2013/12/12/H-000-MSG3__-MSG3________-*201312121000*")
	>>> sc = Scene(filenames={"seviri_l1b_hrit": fn_sev, "cmsaf-claas2_l2_nc": fn_cmsaf})
	>>> sc.load(["reff", "IR_108", "IR_087", "cot", "IR_016", "VIS006", "IR_120", "VIS008", "cwp", "IR_039"])

.. _EEA: https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/copernicus-land-monitoring-service-eu-dem
.. _satpy: https://github.com/pytroll/satpy

.. image:: ./fogpy_docu_example_5.png
	:scale: 74 %

We can now visualise any of those datasets using the regular pytroll
visualisation toolkit.  Let's first resample the scene again::

    >>> ls = sc.resample("eurol")

And then inspect the cloud optical thickness product::

    >>> from trollimage.xrimage import XRImage
    >>> from trollimage.colormap import set3
    >>> xrim = XRImage(ls["cot"])
    >>> set3.set_range(0, 100)
    >>> xrim.palettize(set3)
    >>> xrim.show()

Get hands-on fogpy at daytime
=================================

After we imported all required metadata we can continue with a fogpy composite.

.. note::
	Make sure that the ``PPP_CONFIG_DIR`` includes ``fogpy/etc/`` directory!

Fogpy comes with its own ``etc/composites/seviri.yaml``.
By setting ``PPP_CONFIG_DIR=/path/to/fogpy/etc``, Satpy will find the fogpy
composites and all fogpy composites can be used directly in Satpy.

Let's try it with the *fls_day* composite.  This composite determines
low clouds and ground fog cells from a satellite scene.  It is limited
to daytime because it requires channels in the visible spectrum to be
successfully applicable and because the cloud microphysical properties
are only available during the day.  Let's focus on Germany now::

    >>> ls = sc.resample("germ2")
    
We create a fogpy composite for the resampled MSG scene::

    >>> ls.load(["fls_day"])

This may take a while to complete.  Although most Satpy composites use
dask for postponed evaluation, Fogpy does not currently support this.
You see that we don't have to import the fogpy package manually.
It's done automagically in the background after the satpy configuration.

The *fls_day* composite function calculates a new dataset, that is now
available like any other Satpy dataset, such as by ``ls["fls_day"]``
or ``ls.show("fls_day")``.
The dataset has two bands:
 
- Band ``L`` is an image of a selected channel (Default is the 10.8 IR channel) where only the detected ground fog cells are displayed
- Band ``A`` is an image for the fog mask

::
    
    >>> ls.show("fls_day")

.. image:: ./fogpy-germ2-fls_day.jpg

The result image shows the area with potential ground fog calculated
by the algorithm.  But the remaining areas are missing... maybe
a different visualization could be helpful.  We can improve the image
output by colorising the fog mask and blending it over an overview composite
using trollimage:

.. Wait for this composite to work correctly
.. 
.. Fogpy comes with a Satpy enhancement file in
.. ``etc/enhancements/generic.yaml``, which defines an enhanced visualisation
.. for the Fogpy ``fls_day`` composite, which we will use::

::

    >>> import satpy.writers
    >>> import xarray as xr
    >>> from trollimage.xrimage import XRImage
    >>> from trollimage.colormap import Colormap
    >>> ls.load(["overview"])
    >>> ov = satpy.writers.get_enhanced_image(ls["overview"]).convert("RGBA")
    >>> A = ls["fls_day"].sel(bands="A")
    >>> Ap = A.where(A==0, 0.5)
    >>> im = XRImage(Ap)
    >>> im.stretch()
    >>> fogcol = trollimage.colormap.Colormap(
    ...     (0.0, (0.0, 0.0, 0.8)),
    ...     (1.0, (250 / 255, 200 / 255, 40 / 255)))
    >>> im.colorize(fogcol)
    >>> RGBA = xr.concat([im.data, Ap], dim="bands")
    >>> blend = ov.blend(XRImage(RGBA))

.. image:: ./fogpy-germ2-blend.jpg

Here are some example algorithm results for the given MSG scene. 
As described above, the different masks are blendes over the overview RGB composite in yellow, except the right image where the fog RGB is in the background:

.. FIXME: Not updated beyond this point!

+----------------------------------------+----------------------------------------+----------------------------------------+
| .. image:: ./fogpy_docu_example_13.png | .. image:: ./fogpy_docu_example_12.png | .. image:: ./fogpy_docu_example_14.png |
+----------------------------------------+----------------------------------------+----------------------------------------+
|              Cloud mask                |               Low cloud mask           |         Low cloud mask + Fog RGB       |
+----------------------------------------+----------------------------------------+----------------------------------------+

It looks like the cloud mask works correctly, except of some missclassified snow pixels in the Alps.
But this is not a problem due to the snow filter which successfully masked them out later in the algorithm. 
Interestingly low cloud areas that are found by the algorithm fit quite good to the fog RGB yellowish areas.

On a foggy night ... 
=================================

We saw how daytime fog detection can be realized with the fogpy *fls_day* composite.
But mostly fog occuring during nighttime. So let's continue with another composite
for nighttime fog detection **fls_night**:.

.. note::
	Again make sure that the fogpy composites are made available in satpy!

.. fixme::
    This part of documentation needs updating!

First we need the nighttime MSG scene::

    >>> fn_nwcsaf = glob("/media/nas/x21308/scratch/NWCSAF/*100000Z.nc") # FIXME: UPDATE!
    >>> fn_sev = glob("/media/nas/x21308/scratch/SEVIRI/*201904151000*") # FIXME: UPDATE!
    >>> sc = Scene(filenames={"seviri_l1b_hrit": fn_sev, "nwcsaf-geo": fn_nwcsaf})
    >>> sc.load(["IR_108, "IR_039", "night_fog"])

Reproject it to the central European section from above and have a look at the infrared channel::
 
    >>> ls = sc.resample("eurol")
    >>> ls.show(10.8)

.. image:: ./fogpy_docu_nexample_1.png

We took the same day (12. December 2017) as above. Now we could check whether the low
clouds, that are present at 10 am, already can be seen early in the the morning (4 am) before sun rise.

So let's look at the nighttime fog RGB product::

    >>> ls.show("night_fog")

.. image:: ./fogpy_docu_nexample_2.png

As we see, a lot of greenish-yellow colored pixels are present in the night scene. 
This is a clear indication for low clouds and fog. In addition these areas have a similar form and
distribution as the low clouds in the daytime scene.
We can conclude that these low clouds should have formed during the night.
 
So let's create the fogpy nighttime composite.
Fogpy will use the PyTroll package `pyorbital`_ for solar zenith angle
calculations, so make sure this one is installed.
The nightime composite for the resampled MSG scene
is generated in the same way like the daytime composite with `satpy`_::

    >>> ls.load(["fls_night"])
    >>> ls.show("fls_night")

.. image:: ./fogpy_docu_nexample_3.png

.. _pyorbital: https://github.com/pytroll/pyorbital

It seems, the detected low cloud cells in the composite overestimate the presence of low clouds,
if we compare the RGB product to it. In general, the nighttime algorithm exhibit higher uncertainty for the detection of low
clouds than the daytime approach. Therefore a comparison with weather station data could be useful.

Gimme some ground truth!
========================

.. note::
    Documentation beyond this point out of date!

Fogpy features some additional utilities for validation and comparison attempts.
This include methods to plot weather station data from Bufr files over the FLS image results.
The Bufr data is thereby processed by the `trollbufr`_ PyTroll package and the images are generated with `trollimage`_.
Here we load visibility data from German weather stations for the nighttime scene::
    
    >>> import os
    >>> from fogpy.utils import add_synop
        # Define search path for bufr file
    >>> bufr_dir = '/path/to/bufr/file/'
    >>> from datetime import datetime
    >>> ntime = datetime(2013, 12, 12, 4, 0)
    >>> nbufr_file = "result_{}_synop.bufr".format(ntime.strftime("%Y%m%d%H%M"))
    >>> inbufrn = os.path.join(bufr_dir, nbufr_file)
        # Create station image
    >>> station_nimg = add_synop.add_to_image(nfls_img, tiffarea, ntime, inbufrn, ptsize=4)
    >>> station_nimg.show()

.. image:: ./fogpy_docu_nexample_4.png

.. image:: ./fogcolbar.png
	:scale: 60 %

.. _trollbufr: https://github.com/alexmaul/trollbufr

The red dots represent fog reports with visibilities below 1000 meters (compare with legend),
whereas green dots show high visibility situations at ground level.
We see that low clouds, classified by the nighttime algorithm not always correspond to ground fog.
Here the station data is a useful addition to distinguish between ground fog and low stratus.

At daytime we can make the same comparison with station data::

    >>> bufr_file = "result_{}_synop.bufr".format(time.strftime("%Y%m%d%H%M"))
    >>> inbufr = os.path.join(bufr_dir, bufr_file)
        # Create station image
    >>> station_img = add_synop.add_to_image(fls_img, tiffarea, time, inbufr, ptsize=4)
    >>> station_img.show()

.. image:: ./fogpy_docu_example_15.png

We see that the low cloud area in Northern Germany has not been classified as ground fog by the algorithm,
whereas the southern part fits quite good to the station data.
Furthermore some mountain stations within the area of the ground fog mask exhibit high visibilities.
This difference is induced by the averaged evelation from the DEM, the deviated lower cloud height and the 
real altitude of the station which could lie above the expected cloud top.
In addition the low cloud top height assignment can exhibit uncertainty in cases where a elevation 
based height assignment is not possible and a fixed temperature gradient approach is applied.  
These missclassifications could be improved by using ground station visibility data 
as algorithm input. The usage of station data as additional filter could refine the ground fog mask.

Luckily we can use the StationFusionFilter class from fogpy to combine the satellite mask with ground 
station visibility data. We use several dataset that had been calculated through out the tour as filter input
and plot the filter result::

    >>> from fogpy.filters import StationFusionFilter
        # Define filter input
    >>> flsoutmask = np.array(fogmask.channels[0], dtype=bool)
    >>> filterinput = {'ir108': dem_scene[10.8].data,
    >>>                'ir039': dem_scene[3.9].data,
    >>>                'lowcloudmask': flsoutask,
    >>>                'elev': elevation.image_data,
    >>>                'bufrfile': inbufr,
    >>>                'time': time,
    >>>                'area': tiffarea}
        # Create fusion filter
    >>> stationfilter = StationFusionFilter(dem_scene[10.8].data, **filterinput)
    >>> stationfilter.apply()
    >>> stationfilter.plot_filter()

.. image:: ./fogpy_docu_example_16.png

The data fusion revise the low cloud clusters in Northern Germany and East Europe as ground fog again.
The filter uses ground station data to correct false classification and add missing ground fog cases 
by utilising a DEM based interpolation. Furthermore cases under high clouds are also extrapolated by 
elevation information. This cloud lead to low cloud confidence levels. For example the fog mask over
France and England. The applicatin of this filter should be limited to a region for which station data
is available to achieve a high qualitiy data fusion product. In this case the area should be cropped to
Germany, which can be done by setting the *limit* attribute to *True*::

    >>> filterinput['limit'] = True
        # Create fusion filter with limited region
    >>> stationfilter = StationFusionFilter(dem_scene[10.8].data, **filterinput)
    >>> stationfilter.apply()
    >>> stationfilter.plot_filter()

.. image:: ./fogpy_docu_example_17.png
    :scale: 120 %

The output is now limited automagically to the area for which station data is available. 

The above station fusion filter example can be used to code any other filter application in fogpy.
The command sequence more or less looks like the same: 
 
 - Prepare filter input
 - Instantiate filter class object
 - Run the filter
 - Enjoy the results 

All available filters are listed in the chapter :ref:`filters`. Whereas the algorithms that can be directly
applied to PyTroll *Scene* objects can be found in the :ref:`algorithms` section.
